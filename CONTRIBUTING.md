# Contributing to Pantree

Whether you're a CS4500 Senior Project student or somebody who is extremely passionate about niche kitchen applications, everybody has the ability to contribute to Pantree! If you're unsure how to get started or what still needs to be done, you're not alone! All of us have no idea what we're doing. If you'd like to get into contact with the team, feel free to join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/n4pzrTGPQJ) and introduce yourself! Be warned, none of us have been outside for about a year now and as a result have near non-existent social skills. 

  If you haven't been scared away, the steps to creating a pull request will surely make you re-think your decision about wanting to contribute! In case they don't, we promote a healthy learning environment in which questions are encouraged. If there is a task that hasn't been assigned, feel free to look into it and attempt a draft! The worst thing that can happen is one of us will try to talk to you.


**Here are the basic steps to submitting a pull request:**

  1. Open the CS4500 [Scrum board](https://github.com/Theauxm/Pantree/projects/2), and assign a task in the "Backlog" or "In Sprint" column to yourself.

      Each task within the Scrum board will be categorized into a subsection denoting which view (nav tab) it is apart of. These will include:
      - Pantry View (PV): All items within the user's pantry
      - Shopping List View (SLV): All shopping lists the user has created
      - Recipe Recommendation View (RRV): All available recipes within the app
      - Social View (SV): Dynamic shopping lists and events
      - Back End (PE): Any and all back-end requirements

  2. Clone the repository and create a branch. The naming convention of the branch follows the name of the task. The first letters should correspond to the acronym, followed by a '/', then the number of the task and the name. I.e., if the task is "CT69 - Eat Pancakes", the branch should be named: "CT/69_EAT_PANCAKES".
  3. Follow our setup guidelines to compile the project, which can be accessed via the README.txt file
  4. Go to the issues page within the GitHub repository, find your issue, and fill out the [pull request form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4cbKbxN26LJqt4yaYjbfqdAbc3Unhsxnh0U967ei4c/edit?usp=sharing). *NOTE: Filling this out to the best of your ability will speed the process along, no one who has a Computer Science degree knows how to read English past a 5th grade level.*




The task's name will start with the acronym, along with a unique number to associate with it. Within each task, the [task form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMjXoHocey8QCICZziE2Ia0_UgGrKt38Pvrd6G--DG0/edit?usp=sharing) will be filled out so each developer has an idea of what the task is for.

That's it! Someone from the Pantree team will take a look at your issue and make any necessary comments. Thank you for helping our team make the best application we can! â™¥
