<p>Brandon, Trey, Ben, and Theaux met during their first year at the University of Utah. After working together throughout various classes and other semester long projects, they decided to group together for their senior project. Pantree started as a simple idea over the COVID19 pandemic in an attempt to keep a living space a bit more clean and save money. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each other, working together has been an overall very positive experience.</p>

<p>My main contributions to the pantree project have been located within the social view, and some of the social aspects related to it. We wanted the ability for users to easily share the amazing creations that they have made, as well as having easy access to other users of the application, and the ability to see what they were cooking. This extended to mingling with some of the other views, such as the recipe view, where users can easily see what recipes other users have made, and add them to the ingredients to their own shopping cart if they would like to try it!</p>

<p>I worked on a lot of the back-end for Pantree and the Recipe tab. Brandon and I collaborated on figuring out the structure of the database, and I created a web scraper to make sure users have the ability to make whatever kind of food they want! Users can add their own recipes to the database for others to create, seeing as the main goal of the app is to be able to share food with others.</p>
