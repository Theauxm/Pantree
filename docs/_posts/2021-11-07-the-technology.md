### Flutter and the Google technology stack

### Why Flutter?
In an age where creating your own framework might be right around the corner.. why did the Pantree team decide to use Flutter and the Google technology stack? That, reader, is a fantastic question. There are a few reasons why Flutter shines a bit brighter than many current frameworks. 

### Cross-Platform Support
In our case, the most notable feature was the cross-platform support. Our first goal was to make a mobile application, as we believed that this would be the most useful medium for our application to be used on. As Flutter has support for iOS, Android, and Web, this felt like a very easy option for us as we would not have to develop three separate applications to serve the same code, we could keep it all in one project, which is much easier to maintain.

### Dart and Flutter 2.0
Google's home cooked language and framework were definitely a bit to get used to but we quickly found the strengths for both of these. One of our favorite features that was pivotal for many of our features is the framework's ability to handle state of the application. In our initial set up, we definitely viewed this as more of a hurdle, as state was something that most of us on the team had not encountered before - but the benefits it provided when we found out how to use it were great, and will come further into focus in the next section.
