In short, Pantree is a Kitchen Management App desgined to help reduce waste by providing a platform to organize what you have in your pantry and refrigerator. We aimed to do this in a few different ways.

First, the app provides a way to add any type of food to a Pantry, keeping track of the date the item was added. This allows a user to see what may be about to expire, cutting down on food that may need to be thrown away. Dynamic pantries allow multiple users to be apart of the same pantry, giving those who live together a way to know exactly what is available at any time.

Second, there is a Recipe tab in the app that provides a way for users to filter based on what they'd like to make, or search directly for something they have in mind. The missing ingredients function allows users to see exactly what they don't have, rather than having to do all the mental math on their own. Users can also create their own recipes as well!

Third, a Shopping List tab is provided as a way to organize future grocery store/market visits, allowing for easy integration into a Pantry once the items are back home. The Recipe tab allows users to export recipe items directly into a shopping list, cutting down on the amount of time it takes to figure out what is and isn't necessary to purchase.

Lastly, the Social Tab is available to show off finished products! There is functionality to add and remove friends, allowing for collaborators to be added to a pantry. Posts can also be created to show off what users have created, or upload instructions via photo on how to make a specific dish.
