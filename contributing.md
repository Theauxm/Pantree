Whether you're a CS4500 Senior Project student or somebody who is extremely passionate about niche kitchen applications, everybody has the ability to contribute to Pantree! If you're unsure how to get started or what still needs to be done, you're not alone! All of us have no idea what we're doing. If you'd like to get into contact with the team, feel free to join our Discord channel and introduce yourself! Be warned, none of us have been outside for about a year now and as a result have near non-existent social skills. 

If you haven't been scared away just yet, the steps to creating a pull request will surely make you re-think your decision about wanting to contribute! Regardless, we promote a healthy learning environment in which questions are encouraged. If there is a task that hasn't been assigned, feel free to look into it and attempt a draft! The worst thing that can happen is one of us will try to talk to you.

Here are the basic steps to submitting a pull request:

  1. Open the CS4500 Scrum board, https://github.com/Theauxm/Pantree/projects/2, and assign a task in the "Backlog" or "In Sprint" column to yourself. 
  2. Clone the repository and create a branch. The naming convention of the branch follows the name of the task. The first letters should correspond to the acronym, followed by a '/', then the number of the task and the name. I.e., if the task is "CT69 - Eat Pancakes", the branch should be named: "CT/69_EAT_PANCAKES".
  3. Follow our setup guidelines to compile the project.
  4. Go to the issues page within the GitHub repository, find your issue, and fill out the pull request form.

That's it! One of the project members will take a look at your issue and make any necessary comments.
